# Analysis I, Section 3.2: Russell's paradox

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

This section is mostly optional, though it does make explicit the axiom of foundation which is
used in a minor role in an exercise in Section 3.5.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Russell's paradox (ruling out the axiom of universal specification).
- The axiom of regularity (foundation) - an axiom designed to avoid Russell's paradox.
